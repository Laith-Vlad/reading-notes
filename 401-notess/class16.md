1. EC2 Instance:
   Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service by AWS that provides resizable virtual machines, allowing users to run applications in the cloud with flexible computing resources.

2. Use Cases for EC2:
   a. Web Hosting and Application Deployment.
   b. Data Processing and Analysis.

3. Reason to use ECS over Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com:
   ECS offers better integration with the AWS ecosystem, streamlining communication with other AWS services like S3, RDS, and VPC, resulting in improved performance, security, and cost optimization for users already using AWS.

1. Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) offering by AWS that simplifies application deployment, management, and scaling in the cloud.

2. Relationship with EC2: Elastic Beanstalk uses EC2 instances to run applications. It abstracts infrastructure complexities and automatically manages the underlying EC2 instances.

3. Benefits:
   - Easy deployment and management
   - Automatic scaling based on traffic
   - Built-in monitoring and logging
   - Seamless integration with other AWS services.
