**Amazon S3:**

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a cloud-based object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to store and retrieve large amounts of data securely, affordably, and reliably.

**Use cases for Amazon S3:**

- Data storage and backup: Storing and backing up files, documents, images, and videos.
- Web hosting: Hosting static websites and web assets like CSS, JS, and media files.
- Data archiving: Long-term storage of infrequently accessed data.
- Content distribution: Distributing content globally to reduce latency for end-users.

**Benefits of using Amazon S3:**

- Scalability: Scales effortlessly to handle any amount of data.
- Durability: Data is redundantly stored across multiple facilities for high durability.
- Security: Provides robust access control and encryption options to protect data.
- Cost-effective: Pay-as-you-go pricing model, with no upfront costs.

**AWS Lambda:**

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by AWS. It allows you to run code without managing servers, paying only for the compute time used during execution.

**Use cases for AWS Lambda:**

- Event-driven tasks: Automatically responding to events from other AWS services.
- Microservices: Building and deploying small, independent functions for specific tasks.
- Data processing: Handling data transformations, filtering, and aggregations.
- Scheduled tasks: Executing functions on a predefined schedule.

**"Serverless" for a non-technical friend:**

"Serverless" is a way of running computer programs without worrying about servers. Instead of managing servers yourself, you just upload your code to a platform like AWS Lambda, and it automatically takes care of running the code when needed. You only pay for the time your code runs, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

**CDN:**

A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of servers distributed globally, designed to deliver web content to users more efficiently.

**How CDN works with website visitors:**

When a user visits a website, the CDN's servers closest to the user's location deliver the website's content, like images, videos, and other files. This reduces the distance data travels, making the website load faster and improving the user experience.

**Benefits of employing a CDN:**

- Faster load times: Content is delivered from servers closer to users, reducing latency.
- Improved performance: Reduced load on the website's origin server, freeing up resources.
- Global scalability: CDN servers worldwide ensure reliable content delivery, even during traffic spikes.
- Enhanced security: CDNs often provide additional security features, protecting against DDoS attacks and other threats.
