**Answer:** I would like to delve into data structures and algorithms, as well as gain proficiency in Node.js, MongoDB, and Next.js.

### Growth Mindset/The power of believing in one's ability to improve

Believing in one's capacity for improvement is crucial for coders and developers, as there will always be challenges to overcome and new things to learn. It is important to value the effort invested more than the final outcome, as continuous effort can lead to improvement. Through persistence and a strong determination, the final results can naturally enhance.

### Grit

Grit is an essential attribute for software developers as it enables them to overcome obstacles and possess the determination to bring about change. Whether it involves enhancing problem-solving skills or seeking career advancements within a company, grit encompasses passion, perseverance, and unwavering commitment to long-term goals.

### Redefining Success

Success does not always align with societal standards established over time. It often involves competing with oneself and defining success on personal terms. Success is about forging one's own path and creating achievements that align with individual aspirations.
